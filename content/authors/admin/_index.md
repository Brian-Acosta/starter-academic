Hi, I'm Brian! I'm a Ph.D. student in \[MEAM](https://www.me.upenn.edu/) and the \[GRASP Lab](https://www.grasp.upenn.edu/) at Penn, where I study planning and control for legged robots.

I received my Bachelor of Science in Mechanical Engineering from Purdue University, where I researched in the \[XYZT lab](https://www.xyztlab.com/), advised by Professor Song Zhang. I have also worked as an engineering intern for \[McNeilus Truck and Manufacturing](https://www.mcneiluscompanies.com/) and \[John Deere](https://www.deere.com/en/).
