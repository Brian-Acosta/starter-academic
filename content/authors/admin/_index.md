Hi, I'm Brian! I'm a Ph.D. student in [MEAM](https://www.me.upenn.edu/) and the [GRASP Lab](https://www.grasp.upenn.edu/) at Penn, where I study planning and control for legged robots. My research interests are broadly at the intersection of model based control design and machine learning. 

Before coming to Penn, I received my Bachelor of Science in Mechanical Engineering from Purdue University, where I researched in the [XYZT lab](https://www.xyztlab.com/) and interned as a mechanical engineer for Oshkosh Corporation and John Deere.
